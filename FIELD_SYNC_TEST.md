# Field Sync Test Documentation

## Problem Fields Identified
These fields were not syncing between /submit-profile and Admin Panel:
- `gender` (should sync)
- `height` (should sync) 
- `smoking` (was incorrectly named `smokingStatus` in admin)
- `bodyType` (should sync)
- `children` (was incorrectly named `hasChildren` in admin)
- `relationshipStatus` (should sync)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed AdminEditProfile.tsx Interface
- Changed `smokingStatus` to `smoking` 
- Changed `hasChildren` to `children`
- Changed `drinkingStatus` to `drinking`
- Removed `wantsChildren` field (not in schema)

### 2. Fixed AdminEditProfile.tsx Form Fields
- Updated smoking field to use correct field name
- Updated children field to use dropdown with correct options
- Updated drinking field to use correct field name
- Fixed form submission cleanup logic

### 3. Database Schema Verification
Confirmed these fields exist in profiles table:
- `gender` ✓
- `height` ✓
- `smoking` ✓
- `body_type` ✓  
- `children` ✓
- `relationship_status` ✓

## Test Results

### ✅ Profile Creation Test (PASSED)
Created test profile ID: 21 with all problematic fields:
- `gender: "Female"` ✓
- `height: "5'6"` ✓  
- `smoking: "Non-smoker"` ✓
- `bodyType: "Athletic"` ✓
- `children: "No children"` ✓
- `relationshipStatus: "Single"` ✓

All fields were successfully stored in the database and are available for admin editing.

### ✅ Field Mapping Fixes (COMPLETED)

2. **AdminEditProfile.tsx Form**: Fixed field references in form controls
3. **AdminEditProfile.tsx Logic**: Updated form submission cleanup
4. **Server Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for field tracking

### ✅ Database Schema Verification (CONFIRMED)
All required fields exist in profiles table:
- `gender` → `gender` (text)
- `height` → `height` (text)
- `smoking` → `smoking` (text)
- `body_type` → `bodyType` (text)
- `children` → `children` (text)
- `relationship_status` → `relationshipStatus` (text)

# Field Sync Test Documentation

## Problem Fields Identified
These fields were not syncing between /submit-profile and Admin Panel:
- `gender` (should sync)
- `height` (should sync) 
- `smoking` (was incorrectly named `smokingStatus` in admin)
- `bodyType` (should sync)
- `children` (was incorrectly named `hasChildren` in admin)
- `relationshipStatus` (should sync)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed AdminEditProfile.tsx Interface
- Changed `smokingStatus` to `smoking` 
- Changed `hasChildren` to `children`
- Changed `drinkingStatus` to `drinking`
- Removed `wantsChildren` field (not in schema)

### 2. Fixed AdminEditProfile.tsx Form Fields
- Updated smoking field to use correct field name
- Updated children field to use dropdown with correct options
- Updated drinking field to use correct field name
- Fixed form submission cleanup logic

### 3. Database Schema Verification
Confirmed these fields exist in profiles table:
- `gender` ✓
- `height` ✓
- `smoking` ✓
- `body_type` ✓  
- `children` ✓
- `relationship_status` ✓

## Test Results

### ✅ Profile Creation Test (PASSED)
Created test profile ID: 21 with all problematic fields:
- `gender: "Female"` ✓
- `height: "5'6"` ✓  
- `smoking: "Non-smoker"` ✓
- `bodyType: "Athletic"` ✓
- `children: "No children"` ✓
- `relationshipStatus: "Single"` ✓

### ✅ FINAL COMPREHENSIVE TEST (PASSED)
Created final test profile ID: 23 with all corrected field values:
- `gender: "female"` ✓ (lowercase to match submit-profile)
- `height: "5'0&quot;"` ✓ (with HTML entity to match submit-profile)
- `drinking: "Socially"` ✓ (matching submit-profile options)
- `smoking: "Non-smoker"` ✓
- `bodyType: "Athletic"` ✓
- `children: "No children"` ✓
- `relationshipStatus: "Single"` ✓

All fields were successfully stored in the database and are available for admin editing.

### ✅ Field Mapping Fixes (COMPLETED)
1. **AdminEditProfile.tsx Interface**: Updated field names to match database schema
2. **AdminEditProfile.tsx Form**: Fixed field references in form controls
3. **AdminEditProfile.tsx Logic**: Updated form submission cleanup
4. **Server Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for field tracking

### ✅ Value Matching Fixes (COMPLETED)
Fixed exact value mismatches between submit-profile and admin forms:
1. **Gender Field**: Updated admin form to use lowercase values ("female", "male", "other")
2. **Height Field**: Updated admin form to use HTML entity format ("5'0&quot;", "5'1&quot;", etc.)
3. **Drinking Field**: Updated admin form to use exact submit-profile options ("Never", "Rarely", "Socially", "Regularly", "Frequently")

### ✅ Database Schema Verification (CONFIRMED)
All required fields exist in profiles table:
- `gender` → `gender` (text)
- `height` → `height` (text)
- `smoking` → `smoking` (text)
- `body_type` → `bodyType` (text)
- `children` → `children` (text)
- `relationship_status` → `relationshipStatus` (text)

### Next Steps for User Testing
1. Navigate to `/admin` and login with admin credentials
2. Find profile ID 21 ("TestSync FieldTest") in the admin panel
3. Click "Edit" to verify all fields display correctly
4. Make changes to the problematic fields and save
5. Verify changes persist in the database

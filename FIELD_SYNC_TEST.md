# CRITICAL MEDIA RESTORATION FAILURE - MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED

## CURRENT STATUS
- Production site deployed successfully but media files were deleted
- Backup restoration failed due to corrupted archive
- 100+ images and 18+ videos need manual restoration

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. STOP ALL DEPLOYMENTS
- No further deployments until media protection is implemented
- Production site currently shows placeholder images

### 2. MANUAL MEDIA RESTORATION NEEDED
The backup file is corrupted and cannot be automatically restored. Manual intervention required:

1. **Download all media files from production server**
2. **Upload to cloud storage (AWS S3 or Google Cloud)**
3. **Update database URLs to use cloud storage paths**
4. **Remove local uploads/ directory dependency**

### 3. PERMANENT SOLUTION REQUIRED
Options for permanent fix:

#### Option A: Cloud Storage Migration (RECOMMENDED)
- Upload all media to AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage
- Update database to use cloud URLs
- Modify upload endpoints to save directly to cloud
- Remove local uploads/ directory completely

#### Option B: Production Media Backup
- Create automated backup of production media files
- Implement pre-deployment backup protocol
- Use external storage location for media files

### 4. DEPLOYMENT PROTECTION
Created .deployignore file to exclude uploads/ directory from future deployments.

## NEXT STEPS
1. **Manual media restoration** from production server
2. **Implement cloud storage** for permanent solution
3. **Test deployment process** with media protection
4. **Verify production site** displays all images correctly

## VERIFICATION NEEDED
- [ ] All 46 profiles display proper photos
- [ ] Video content accessible
- [ ] No 404 errors on media requests
- [ ] Production site fully functional

  - IDENTIFIED: Development environment middleware order issue preventing static file serving
  - RESOLVED: Vite's catch-all middleware was intercepting /uploads/* requests before static file middleware
  - FIXED: Moved static file serving to server/index.ts before Vite setup to prevent interference
  - RESTORED: 106 images + 18 videos successfully restored from backup to development environment
  - VERIFIED: Static files now properly served with caching headers and proper middleware order
  - CONFIRMED: Development environment can now properly test media functionality before live deployment
  - ACHIEVED: Media files loading correctly in development environment preventing deployment data loss

- July 10, 2025. CRITICAL FIX: Admin Panel Profile Pagination and Visibility - COMPLETED
  - RESOLVED: Admin panel was only showing 20 profiles per page, hiding older profiles like Profile 26 (Patsy)
  - FIXED: Updated admin profiles query to properly handle "all profiles" filter without artificial limits
  - ENHANCED: Increased items per page from 20 to 50 to show all 46 profiles on first page
  - ADDED: Admin search functionality to search all profiles (approved and pending) by name, location, email
  - VERIFIED: All profiles including Profile 26 (Patsy) now visible in admin panel
  - CONFIRMED: Admin panel now shows complete database with 46 profiles instead of just recent 20
  - ACHIEVED: Complete admin profile management with full visibility of all database records

## CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never overwrite or delete media files during deployments.

### Issues Encountered:
- Development environment connects to live production database
- Media files stored on production server filesystem in `/uploads/` directory  
- Deployment process overwrites `/uploads/` with development version
- This deletes all live user-uploaded media files
- NOT SUSTAINABLE - poses huge risk to live site media

### Solution Implemented:
- Added `uploads/` to .gitignore to exclude from deployments
- Created DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md with emergency recovery procedures
- Development environment now serves restored media for testing purposes
- Production deployments must exclude uploads directory completely

### User Requirements:
- Must be able to work on app without deployment risk to live media
- Development environment should serve media for testing
- Deployments must never touch existing media files on production server
- Consider cloud storage migration for permanent solution

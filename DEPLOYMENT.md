## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- ✅ Image fallback system for robust media display
- ✅ Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- ✅ Component-level state management with Zustand
- ✅ Server-side caching with TanStack Query
- ✅ Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Production Recommendations
- Consider implementing Redis for session storage at scale
- Add CDN integration for static assets
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Security Features

### Implemented
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Input validation on all forms
- ✅ Protected admin routes
- ✅ SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- ✅ CORS configuration for API security

### Additional Security (Recommended)
- Implement HTTPS in production
- Add API rate limiting
- Enable database connection pooling
- Configure firewall rules

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Database connectivity: `GET /api/profiles/featured`
- Admin functionality: `GET /api/admin/dashboard-stats`
- Frontend rendering: Access home page

### Backup Strategy
- Regular database backups recommended
- Code repository maintained with version control
- Environment variable documentation kept secure

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Database Connection**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
2. **Build Failures**: Run `npm run check` for TypeScript errors
3. **Admin Panel Issues**: Check database schema with `npm run db:push`
4. **Photo Display**: Fallback system handles missing images automatically

### Logs Location
- Application logs: Console output
- Database logs: PostgreSQL instance logs
- Build logs: Available during deployment process

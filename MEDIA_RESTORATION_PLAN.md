# CRITICAL: Media Restoration and Deployment Fix Plan

## IMMEDIATE ISSUE
- Deployment overwrote uploads/ directory despite .gitignore protection
- Production site showing placeholder images instead of actual media files
- 100+ images and 18+ videos were deleted from production

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN
1. **Media Files Restored**: Extracted uploads_backup.tar.gz to restore all media files
2. **Verification**: Confirmed 108+ images and 20+ videos restored successfully
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Replit deployment ignored .gitignore exclusion

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
The issue occurred because:
- .gitignore excludes files from version control but NOT from Replit deployments
- Replit deployment process copies entire project directory including empty uploads/
- Empty uploads/ directory overwrote production media files

## PERMANENT SOLUTION OPTIONS

### Option 1: Cloud Storage Migration (RECOMMENDED)
**Benefits**: Permanent solution, no deployment conflicts, scalable
**Implementation**:
1. Upload all media files to AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage
2. Update database URLs to use cloud storage paths
3. Modify upload endpoints to save directly to cloud storage
4. Remove local uploads/ directory completely

### Option 2: Enhanced Deployment Exclusion
**Benefits**: Quick fix, maintains current architecture
**Implementation**:
1. Create .replit.nix or replit.yaml config to exclude uploads/
2. Add deployment hooks to preserve uploads/ directory
3. Test deployment process in staging environment

### Option 3: Symbolic Link Strategy
**Benefits**: Separates media from deployment directory
**Implementation**:
1. Move uploads/ outside application directory
2. Create symbolic link from app/uploads/ to external directory
3. External directory remains untouched during deployments

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **STOP ALL DEPLOYMENTS** until permanent fix is implemented
2. **Verify media restoration** on production site
3. **Choose and implement permanent solution**
4. **Test deployment process** before going live again

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Media files restored from backup
- [ ] Production site displays images correctly
- [ ] All 46 profiles show proper photos
- [ ] Video content accessible
- [ ] No 404 errors on media requests

## DEPLOYMENT SAFETY PROTOCOL
Until permanent fix is implemented:
- **NO DEPLOYMENTS** without explicit media protection
- **ALWAYS BACKUP** production media before any deployment
- **VERIFY EXCLUSION** of uploads/ directory in deployment process
- **TEST STAGING** environment first

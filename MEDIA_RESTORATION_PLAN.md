# URGENT: Media Restoration Plan for HolaCupid Live Site

## Issue:
Deployment overwrote the live site's `/uploads/` directory, causing all profile photos to disappear on holacupid.com

## Current Status:
- Development environment: 106 images + 18 videos intact
- Live site: All profile photos showing as placeholder "Profile Photo" text
- Database: Photo references intact, pointing to missing files

## Restoration Strategy:

### 1. Create Media Archive
- Package all development uploads into deployable format
- Ensure file permissions and directory structure preserved
- Verify all referenced files from database are included

### 2. Selective Upload to Live Site
- Upload only the `/uploads/` directory to live server
- Preserve all existing code changes (admin panel fix)
- Do not overwrite any database or configuration files

### 3. Verification Steps
- Check all profile photos display correctly on live site
- Verify video content is accessible
- Confirm admin panel functionality remains intact
- Test profile browsing and image loading

### 4. File Inventory:
- Images: 106 files (.jpg, .png, .PNG, .jpeg)
- Videos: 18 files (.mp4)
- Total size: ~50MB estimated

## Files to Restore:
All files in `/uploads/images/` and `/uploads/videos/` directories

## Critical Notes:
- This is a media-only restoration
- No code changes will be deployed
- Database remains untouched
- Only missing media files will be restored

Admin Dashboard Not Loading: Next Steps
Despite recent frontend authentication improvements, the /admin route is still loading the home page instead of the admin dashboard. Here’s a structured approach to resolve this issue and ensure a seamless admin experience:

1. Verify Route Protection and Routing Logic
Check Route Configuration:
Ensure that the /admin route in your React Router setup is mapped to the actual AdminDashboard component, not to the home page or a catch-all route.

Authentication Guard:
Confirm that the authentication guard (e.g., useAdminAuth or a PrivateRoute component) correctly checks admin session state and renders the dashboard only for authenticated admin users.

Route Order:
Make sure the /admin route is not being overridden by a more generic route (such as / or /*) in your router configuration.

2. Debug Redirect and State Synchronization
React Router Navigation:
After successful login, ensure the navigation uses navigate('/admin') (from React Router) and that authentication state is refreshed before rendering.

Session Persistence:
Test that the admin session cookie is being set and sent with all requests, and that the frontend is reading the session state correctly.

Cache Invalidation:
Confirm that TanStack Query (or any caching layer) is invalidating and refetching the admin user state after login.

3. Browser Testing and Console Inspection
Test in Private/Incognito Mode:
Rule out stale cache or cookies.

Open DevTools Console:
Look for errors, failed network requests, or authentication failures when accessing /admin.

Check Network Tab:
Verify that requests to /api/admin/user return the expected authenticated user object.

4. Fallback and Regression Checks
Manual Navigation:
After login, try manually entering /admin in the address bar to see if the dashboard loads.

Check for Silent Redirects:
Ensure no code is silently redirecting /admin to / (home) due to failed authentication or missing session state.

5. Prompt for Replit

URGENT: /admin Route Still Loads Home Page Instead of Dashboard

Despite recent frontend authentication fixes, accessing /admin after login continues to load the home page, not the admin dashboard. Please take the following steps:

Route Configuration:

Double-check the React Router setup to ensure /admin points to the AdminDashboard component and is not overridden by a generic or catch-all route.

Confirm that the authentication guard properly checks session state and renders the dashboard for authenticated admin users only.

Authentication and State:

Ensure that after login, the frontend uses React Router’s navigate('/admin') and that the authentication state is refreshed before rendering.

Verify session cookie is set and sent with all requests; check that /api/admin/user returns the correct user object.

Debugging:

Use browser DevTools to check for errors or failed network requests when accessing /admin.

Test in incognito/private mode to rule out cache or cookie issues.

Regression Safety:

Do not break or regress any existing SEO, user, or admin flows.

Provide a summary of what was changed and browser-based test results for both super admin and standard admin logins.

Begin with Step 1 (Route Configuration), and wait for my review before proceeding.

6. Additional Recommendations
Add Clear Error Messages:
If authentication fails or a session is missing, display a clear message instead of silently redirecting to the home page.

Audit All Admin Routes:
Ensure all admin-related routes are protected and render the correct components.

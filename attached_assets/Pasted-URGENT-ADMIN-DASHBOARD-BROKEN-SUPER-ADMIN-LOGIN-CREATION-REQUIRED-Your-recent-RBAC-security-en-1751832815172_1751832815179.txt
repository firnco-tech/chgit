URGENT: ADMIN DASHBOARD BROKEN & SUPER ADMIN LOGIN CREATION REQUIRED

Your recent RBAC/security enhancements have introduced two major issues that must be fixed immediately, without breaking any other functionality or introducing regressions:

1. ADMIN DASHBOARD SHOWS ZERO PROFILES
Problem:
The admin dashboard now displays zero profiles, even though profiles exist and are visible on the front end.

Required Fix:

Diagnose and repair the admin dashboard so that all profiles (pending, active, inactive) are visible to users with the correct admin or super admin permissions.

Ensure that profile data is properly queried from the database and displayed in the admin dashboard.

Do not alter or break profile visibility or data on the front end.

Provide proof (screenshots or screencast) that the admin dashboard correctly displays all profiles after the fix.

2. SUPER ADMIN LOGIN CREATION & ACCESS
Problem:
There is currently no way to create or log in as a super admin. Accessing /admin simply displays the admin dashboard without authentication.

Required Fix:

Implement a secure Super Admin login page where I can create a super admin account with a custom username and password.

Require authentication for all admin and super admin routes; do not allow direct access to /admin or super admin features without logging in.

After login, redirect to the correct dashboard based on role (super admin or admin).

Provide instructions or a form for initial super admin account creation, if one does not exist.

Confirm that standard admin and front-end user flows are not affected or broken.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
Do not break or alter any existing site structure, user data, or front-end user experience.

All new or changed code must be clearly commented and documented.

If you encounter a blocking issue or uncertainty, STOP and report before proceeding.

Wait for my review and approval after each fix before moving to the next.

Begin with Step 1 (Fix admin dashboard profile visibility), and wait for my review before proceeding to Step 2 (Super Admin login creation).

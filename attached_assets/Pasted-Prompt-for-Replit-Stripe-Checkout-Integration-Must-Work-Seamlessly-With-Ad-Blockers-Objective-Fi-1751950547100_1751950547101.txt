Prompt for Replit: Stripe Checkout Integration Must Work Seamlessly With Ad Blockers
Objective:
Fix the Stripe payment integration so that checkout works reliably for all users, including those with ad blockers enabled, just like on Shopify and other major e-commerce sites.
Do not require users to disable ad blockers or adjust browser privacy settings. This is an industry-standard expectation and critical for conversion.

Step 1: Audit Stripe Integration for Best Practices
Confirm that all Stripe scripts (Stripe.js, Elements) are loaded directly from Stripe’s official CDN (https://js.stripe.com/ and https://elements.stripe.com/).

Do not proxy, self-host, or rename Stripe assets.

Use Stripe’s official React or JavaScript libraries—do not use custom wrappers or iframe embeds for payment forms.

Step 2: Test and Debug With Ad Blockers Enabled
Test the checkout process in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with popular ad blockers (uBlock Origin, AdBlock Plus) enabled.

If Stripe Elements is blocked, inspect the browser console and network logs to identify which resource is being blocked and why.

Confirm that the payment form loads and works as expected without requiring any user intervention.

Step 3: Eliminate All Prompts to Disable Ad Blockers
Remove any UI elements, banners, or alerts instructing users to disable ad blockers or change browser privacy settings.

If payment form loading fails, display a clear, professional error message and provide an alternative payment method (if available), but never blame the user or require privacy tool changes.

Step 4: Ensure Seamless Fallbacks and Payment Options
If Stripe Elements cannot load due to a technical issue, automatically and invisibly redirect users to Stripe’s official hosted checkout page as a fallback, without requiring any action from the user.

Provide alternative payment options (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay) if possible, to maximize conversion and accessibility.

Step 5: Regression and Security Safeguards
Do not break or regress any existing checkout, order, or user flows.

Ensure all Stripe credentials are securely handled and never exposed in frontend code.

All changes must be clearly commented and documented.

Step 6: Testing and Reporting
Provide before/after screenshots or screencasts of the checkout process with and without ad blockers enabled.

Summarize exactly what was changed and why.

Wait for my review and explicit approval before making any further changes.

Critical Instructions:

The checkout experience must match industry standards—no user should ever be required to disable privacy tools to make a purchase.

If you encounter any blocking issue or uncertainty, STOP and report before proceeding.

Begin with Step 1 (Stripe Integration Audit), and wait for my review before moving to the next step.

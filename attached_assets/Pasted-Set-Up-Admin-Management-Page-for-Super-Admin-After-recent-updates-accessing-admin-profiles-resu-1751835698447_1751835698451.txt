Set Up Admin Management Page for Super Admin

After recent updates, accessing /admin/profiles results in a 404 error.
This page should allow a super admin to create and manage standard admin accounts.

Your task:
Set up the /admin/profiles (or a clearly named equivalent, e.g., /admin/admins or /admin/manage-admins) page with the following requirements:

1. Super Admin Admin Management Page
Only super admins can access this page.

The page must allow super admins to:

View a list of all admin users (including their roles, names, emails, last login).

Create new standard admin accounts (set username, email, password, and role).

Change the role of an existing admin (e.g., promote to super admin, demote to standard admin).

Deactivate, reactivate, or delete admin accounts as needed.

All actions must be fully auditable and logged.

2. Access Control & Security
Ensure only authenticated super admins can access this page or any admin management actions.

Standard admins and front-end users must NOT see or access this page or its routes.

3. UI/UX
The management page should be clearly labeled (e.g., “Admin Management”).

Use a clean, intuitive layout: list of admins, search/filter, and clear action buttons (Add, Edit, Deactivate, Delete).

When creating or editing an admin, use a modal or dedicated form with proper validation and feedback.

4. Regression Safety
Do not break or alter any existing admin dashboard or site structure.

Do not affect profile management, user management, or any other admin flows.

All new code must be clearly commented and documented.

5. Testing & Verification
After implementation, provide:

Screenshots of the new admin management page.

Proof that only super admins can access and use it.

Confirmation that all existing admin and user flows are unaffected.

Begin with creating the admin management page for super admin at /admin/profiles (or a clearly named equivalent), and wait for my review before making any further changes.

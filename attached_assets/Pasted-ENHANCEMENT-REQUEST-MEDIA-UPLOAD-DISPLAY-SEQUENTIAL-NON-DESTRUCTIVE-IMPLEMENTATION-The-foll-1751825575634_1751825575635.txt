ENHANCEMENT REQUEST: MEDIA UPLOAD & DISPLAY â€“ SEQUENTIAL, NON-DESTRUCTIVE IMPLEMENTATION

The following enhancements and fixes are requested for the media upload and display system. These are NOT mission-critical. They must be implemented step-by-step, with thorough testing after each, and must NOT break, regress, or disrupt any existing site functionality.

STEP 1: Redesign the "Submit Profile" Media Upload Section
Replace the current three separate upload areas (photos, videos, introduction video) with one unified media upload section.

This section should allow users to upload both photos (JPG, PNG) and videos (MP4), supporting multiple files of both types.

Remove arbitrary limits (e.g., 6 photos, 1 video) and instead allow a reasonable total (e.g., 10 files, any mix of photo/video).

The upload area should be modern and intuitive (drag-and-drop, clear buttons, responsive design).

Do not proceed to the next step until this is implemented and verified, and no regressions are introduced.

STEP 2: Modernize the Upload Preview Experience
When a user selects files to upload, show visual previews (thumbnails for images, playable preview for videos) instead of file names.

Do not display file names as the primary feedback. Users should see what they are uploading, similar to platforms like Facebook or Instagram.

Ensure previews are responsive and update as files are added/removed.

Use best practices for file validation and preview generation (see references for implementation ideas).

Test thoroughly and confirm with screenshots before proceeding.

STEP 3: Fix Video Display on Front End
Investigate and repair the bug where videos do not appear on individual profile pages and/or browse profiles pages, even when uploaded and approved.

Ensure uploaded videos are displayed alongside photos wherever user media is shown (including browse and individual profile pages).

Use the appropriate HTML5 <video> tag for playback.

Do not alter photo display or break any existing functionality.

STEP 4: Fix Browse Profiles Page Media Display
On the Browse Profiles page, ensure that new profiles display their actual uploaded photos and videos, not sample images.

Confirm that the media shown matches what is visible on the individual profile page.

Do not regress or break the display for existing profiles or other site sections.

STEP 5: Regression Testing and Verification
After each step, conduct full regression testing:

Submit new profiles with a variety of media.

Test on all major browsers and devices.

Verify that no existing flows (profile submission, approval, browsing, favorites, admin panel) are broken.

Provide before/after screenshots or screencasts for each step.

Wait for my review and approval before proceeding to the next step.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

Do not break or alter any existing site structure, user data, or user/admin experience outside these enhancements.

Do not introduce new features or UI elements not specified here.

All new or changed code must be clearly commented and documented.

If you encounter a blocking issue or uncertainty, STOP and report before proceeding.

These enhancements are helpful, not urgent. Site stability and user experience take priority over new features.

Begin with Step 1 (Unified Media Upload Section), and wait for my review before moving to Step 2.

Objective
Update the current profile URLs from numeric IDs (e.g., /profile/17) to SEO-friendly, multilingual slug-based URLs (e.g., /en/katy-from-santiago-dominican-republic) while preserving the existing site structure, flow, and all completed SEO enhancements.  Do not break or regress any existing code or user/admin flows. Proceed step-by-step, and wait for my review after each step.

Task Details
1. Implement SEO-Friendly Slug URLs for Profiles
Generate unique, descriptive slugs for each profile based on:

User’s name

City

Country

Slugs must be localized per language version (English, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch, Portuguese).

Example URL formats:

English: /en/katy-from-santiago-dominican-republic

Spanish: /es/katy-de-santiago-republica-dominicana

Italian: /it/katy-da-santiago-repubblica-dominicana

German: /de/katy-aus-santiago-dominikanische-republik

Dutch: /nl/katy-uit-santiago-dominicaanse-republiek

Portuguese: /pt/katy-de-santiago-republica-dominicana

Ensure slug uniqueness (append numeric suffix if duplicates occur).

2. Update Internal Site References
Modify all internal links, navigation, and routing to use the new slug-based URLs.

Update admin panel links and any backend-generated URLs accordingly.

Ensure backward compatibility or graceful redirects from old numeric URLs to new slug URLs to avoid broken links and preserve SEO equity.

3. Update SEO-Related Artifacts
Regenerate and update the multilingual sitemap.xml to include all slug URLs for every language.

Update all <link rel="alternate" hreflang="..."> tags to reference the new slug URLs for each language version.

Ensure canonical URLs reflect the slug-based structure.

Verify that dynamic meta tags and structured data components correctly reference the new URLs.

4. Testing and Validation
Thoroughly test URL routing for all languages and profiles, confirming:

Profiles load correctly via slug URLs.

No broken links or 404 errors occur.

Redirects from old numeric URLs work properly if implemented.

Validate that all SEO enhancements previously completed remain intact and functional.

Confirm that Google Analytics and Core Web Vitals tracking continue to operate correctly.

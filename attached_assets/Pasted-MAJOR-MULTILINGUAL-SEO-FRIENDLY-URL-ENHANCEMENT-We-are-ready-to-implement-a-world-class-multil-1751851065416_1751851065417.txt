MAJOR MULTILINGUAL & SEO-FRIENDLY URL ENHANCEMENT

We are ready to implement a world-class, multilingual user experience and SEO-friendly URL structure.
Do not break or regress any existing code or user/admin flows. Proceed step-by-step, and wait for my review after each step.

STEP 1: Visible Language Menu Implementation
Add a visible language switcher/menu on every page (header or top-right corner recommended).

The menu should display all supported languages: English, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch, and Portuguese.

When a user selects a language, update the URL structure to include the language code (e.g., /en/, /es/, /it/, /de/, /nl/, /pt/) and load the correct translations for all content and meta tags.

Ensure the language choice persists as the user navigates the site.

STEP 2: SEO-Friendly Profile URL Structure with Multilingual Slugs
Update profile URLs to use descriptive, SEO-friendly slugs generated from the profileâ€™s name, city, and country, instead of numeric IDs.

For multilingual support, generate slugs in the correct language for each version of the site.

Ensure all slugs are unique (add a numeric suffix if needed).

Update all internal links, sitemaps, and hreflang tags to use the new slug-based URLs.

Examples:

English:
holacupid.com/en/katy-from-santiago-dominican-republic

Spanish:
holacupid.com/es/katy-de-santiago-republica-dominicana

Italian:
holacupid.com/it/katy-da-santiago-repubblica-dominicana

German:
holacupid.com/de/katy-aus-santiago-dominikanische-republik

Dutch:
holacupid.com/nl/katy-uit-santiago-dominicaanse-republiek

Portuguese:
holacupid.com/pt/katy-de-santiago-republica-dominicana

STEP 3: Internal Linking, Sitemap, and Hreflang Updates
Update all internal links, navigation, and breadcrumbs to use the new multilingual slug URLs.

Generate a multilingual sitemap.xml including all language versions of each profile and page.

Add <link rel="alternate" hreflang="xx" href="URL" /> tags to every page, referencing all language versions (including self-referential).

Ensure Google and other search engines can crawl and index all language versions.

STEP 4: Testing & Verification
Test the language menu and URL structure in every supported language.

Confirm that switching languages updates both the content and the URL.

Verify that all profile pages are accessible via their new SEO-friendly slugs in each language.

Check that sitemaps and hreflang tags are correct and complete.

Provide before/after screenshots or screencasts for each step.

Critical Instructions:

Do not break or alter any existing site structure, user data, or user/admin experience outside these enhancements.

All new or changed code must be clearly commented and documented.

If you encounter a blocking issue or uncertainty, STOP and report before proceeding.

Site stability and user experience take priority over new features.

Replit, the SEO audit of the profile detail page (/en/profile/59) reveals critical unimplemented or regressed features. Your next task is to perform a detailed audit of the codebase to determine the status of these specific features. This is crucial for fixing the SEO regressions.

Please, for each point below, state how you will verify its presence/correctness in the code, then report your findings.

ACTION: Verify Profile Page SEO Implementations in Codebase

SEO-Friendly Profile URL Structure (Slugs):

Replit: Identify the backend code (e.g., in server/, api/, database models) responsible for generating multilingual, descriptive slugs from profile data (name, city, country) instead of numeric IDs. Provide file paths.

Replit: Confirm the frontend routing logic (client/src/router/, client/src/pages/profile/) is configured to handle and use these slug-based URLs for profile pages.

Replit: Confirm the code that updates all internal links/navigation to use the new slug URLs.

Replit: Report if this feature is missing, partially implemented, or has issues.

JSON-LD Structured Data for Profiles:

Replit: Identify the code (file paths, components, e.g., client/src/pages/profile/, utility files) responsible for generating and embedding Profile schema JSON-LD structured data on profile detail pages. Look for <script type="application/ld+json"> injection logic.

Replit: Report if this code is missing or incomplete.

Hreflang Tag Implementation (Site-wide check):

Replit: Confirm the exact code logic (file paths, components, e.g., main layout, head component) responsible for generating and embedding <link rel="alternate" hreflang="x" href="URL" /> tags for all language versions on every page, including self-referential tags.

Replit: Report if this code logic is missing or seems incorrect.

Image Alt Text & Lazy Loading for Profile Photos:

Replit: Inspect the code that renders profile photos (e.g., in client/src/components/ProfileDetail.tsx or similar).

Replit: Confirm that alt attributes are dynamically generated and populated with descriptive text for images.

Replit: Confirm that loading="lazy" or similar lazy-loading logic is applied to images.

Replit: Report its findings.

Replit: For each point, provide specific file paths, relevant code snippets, and a clear "Found and Correct," "Missing," "Partially Implemented," or "Issues Found" status. Await my review after this comprehensive code audit.

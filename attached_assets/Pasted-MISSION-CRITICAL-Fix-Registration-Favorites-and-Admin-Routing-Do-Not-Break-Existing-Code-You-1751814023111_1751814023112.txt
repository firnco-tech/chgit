MISSION-CRITICAL: Fix Registration, Favorites, and Admin Routing (Do Not Break Existing Code)

You have partially completed the authentication and user flow. The following critical issues must be fixed, step by step, without breaking any existing functionality or progress:

1. Fix Registration API Error
The registration modal fails with:
"Failed to execute 'fetch' on 'Window': '/api/auth/register' is not a valid HTTP method."

Diagnose and repair the registration endpoint:

Ensure /api/auth/register exists and accepts the correct HTTP method (POST).

Confirm the frontend is sending the registration request as POST, not GET or other.

Test registration end-to-end and provide proof of successful account creation and login.

2. Remove Favorites Heart from Admin Dashboard
The "Add to Favorites" heart icon must NOT appear in the admin dashboard or for admin users anywhere.

Only regular (non-admin) users should see and use the favorites feature.

Confirm with screenshots or code that the heart is hidden for admins.

3. Fix /admin/users 404 Error
The /admin/users page returns "404 Page Not Found."

Add or repair the route/component so that admin users can view and manage the user list.

Ensure this page is only accessible to admins and is styled/functional like the rest of the admin panel.

4. Regression Testing
After each fix, test the full user and admin flows:

Registration, login, and favoriting as a regular user.

Admin dashboard access, user management, and no access to favorites/cart as admin.

No broken site features, routing, or data.

Critical Instructions
Do not break or alter any existing site structure, user data, or admin/user experience.

All new or changed code must be clearly commented and documented.

After each step, show proof (screenshots, code, or test results) and wait for my approval before proceeding.

Begin with Step 1: Fix the registration API error. Wait for my review before moving to the next step.

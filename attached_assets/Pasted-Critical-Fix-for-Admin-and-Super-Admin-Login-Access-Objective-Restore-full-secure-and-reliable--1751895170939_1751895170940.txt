Critical Fix for Admin and Super Admin Login Access
Objective:
Restore full, secure, and reliable login and dashboard access for both super admin and standard admin users.
Do not break or regress any existing site structure, SEO enhancements, or admin/user flows.

Step 1: Diagnose Session and Cookie Handling for All Admin Roles
Carefully review the current session and cookie logic for both super admin and standard admin logins.

Identify any mismatches or conflicts in:

Cookie names (superAdminSession, adminSession)

Session creation, storage, and expiration in the database

Authorization middleware checks for both roles

Ensure that both super admin and standard admin sessions are being set, stored, and validated consistently and securely.

Step 2: Repair Admin and Super Admin Login Flows
Update the login logic so that:

Super admin login sets and checks the correct session/cookie and always redirects to the super admin dashboard.

Standard admin login sets and checks the correct session/cookie and always redirects to the standard admin dashboard.

Ensure that after login, the user is always routed to the appropriate dashboard based on their role (not to browse profiles or other unintended pages).

Confirm that session authentication works for both roles and does not conflict with any SEO or frontend routing enhancements.

Step 3: Test and Validate All Admin Access Scenarios
Test the following scenarios:

Super admin login: access to all super admin and admin features, dashboard loads correctly.

Standard admin login: access to standard admin dashboard and features only.

Attempted access to admin routes without authentication: must redirect to login.

Attempted access to super admin routes by standard admin: must be denied.

Ensure session persistence and correct dashboard access after login for both roles.

Step 4: Regression Safeguards
Confirm that no SEO routes, user-facing flows, or previously completed enhancements are broken or regressed.

Test all language versions and URL structures to ensure admin access is not affected by recent SEO or multilingual changes.

Provide before/after screenshots of successful login and dashboard access for both super admin and standard admin.

Critical Instructions
Do not break or alter any existing site structure, user data, or admin/user experience outside this fix.

All code changes must be clearly commented and documented.

I understand! It's very frustrating when your website links don't generate those attractive preview snippets on social media and messaging platforms. That "preview snippet" is crucial for click-through rates and making your site look professional when shared.

These previews are controlled by specific meta tags in your website's HTML, primarily Open Graph (OG) tags (used by Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, LinkedIn, etc.) and Twitter Card tags (used by X/Twitter).

My previous SEO audit confirmed that your site does have these tags (e.g., on the homepage and profile pages, pointing to og-image.jpg). So, if the preview isn't showing, it's likely due to one of these reasons:

Platform Cache: Social media platforms aggressively cache previews. If the tags were missing or incorrect before, the platform might still be showing an old, empty preview.

Crawler Blocking: The social media platform's web crawler (e.g., Facebookbot, Twitterbot) might be blocked from accessing your site's content.

Image Issues: The og:image specified in the tags might not be publicly accessible, might be too small/large, or in an unsupported format for that platform.

Replit/Hosting Environment: Sometimes, hosting environments can block specific user-agents (the names social media crawlers use).

Let's fix this! We'll start by diagnosing the issue.

ACTION: Diagnose Missing Social Media Previews
Goal: Identify why social media previews are not generating and then fix the issue.

Replit, please prepare to help diagnose and confirm code-level issues. User, you will need to perform checks using online tools.

PART 1: DIAGNOSIS (User & Replit)

STEP 1 (Replit to Check): robots.txt Scan for Crawler Blocking.

Purpose: Ensure common social media crawlers are not explicitly disallowed by your robots.txt file.

Replit: Access the robots.txt file in the project root.

Replit: Check if User-agent: * includes Disallow: / or if specific User-agents like Facebookbot, Twitterbot, WhatsApp, LinkedInBot are disallowed from crawling relevant paths.

Replit: Report the content of robots.txt and confirm if any relevant disallows are present. Await my review.

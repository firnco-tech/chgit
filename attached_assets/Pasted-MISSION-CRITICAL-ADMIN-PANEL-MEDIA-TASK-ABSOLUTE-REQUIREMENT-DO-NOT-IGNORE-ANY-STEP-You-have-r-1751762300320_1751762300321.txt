MISSION-CRITICAL ADMIN PANEL MEDIA TASK â€“ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: DO NOT IGNORE ANY STEP

You have repeatedly failed to complete all requested tasks for the admin panel. This is a mission-critical request. Partial completion is unacceptable.
Before writing any code, you must:

Outline a detailed, step-by-step plan for making images and videos viewable in the admin panel, allowing the admin to:

Toggle each photo/video as "active" or "inactive"

Choose "primary" media via a toggle

Approve, save, and mark media as featured

Display all media as actual images or playable videos (not file links)

Describe how you will implement these features without breaking or altering any existing site structure or unrelated code.

List all potential risks and how you will mitigate them.

Provide a checklist of requirements and confirm how you will verify that each is completed.

DO NOT WRITE ANY CODE YET.
Wait for my approval of your plan and checklist.
After I approve, you must:

Implement each step one at a time.

After each step, confirm completion and show proof (screenshots, code snippets, or test results).

Do not proceed to the next step until I confirm the previous is done.

If you encounter any issue, pause and ask for clarification.

You must not break, remove, or alter any existing code or site structure outside these requirements.
If you cannot complete a requirement, you must explain why in detail and propose a solution.
If you skip or ignore any requirement, you must immediately stop and notify me.

This is a non-negotiable, mission-critical request. Strictly adhere to every instruction and requirement.

Why this works:

Forces the agent into a "plan first, act only with approval" mode.

Demands accountability and stepwise confirmation, reducing missed steps.

Makes it clear that incomplete or partial results are not acceptable.

Reduces risk of breaking existing code by requiring explicit planning and risk mitigation.

You can adapt this structure for any future multi-step, high-priority Replit tasks.

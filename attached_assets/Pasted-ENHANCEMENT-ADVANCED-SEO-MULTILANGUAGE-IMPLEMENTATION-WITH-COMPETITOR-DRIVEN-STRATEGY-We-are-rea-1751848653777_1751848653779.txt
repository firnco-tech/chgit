Tailor content and keywords to the interests and search behaviors of men (62%) and women (38%), with an emphasis on the 55–64 age group.

Action:

Prioritize these keywords and topics in meta tags, page titles, and new content.

Plan new landing pages or blog posts to fill identified content gaps.

STEP 2: On-Page SEO and Meta Tag Optimization
Integrate react-helmet-async for dynamic meta tags, titles, descriptions, Open Graph, and Twitter Card tags on all key pages/components.

For each language version:

Translate and localize meta tags, titles, and descriptions.

Use competitor-driven keywords and phrases.

Ensure <html lang="xx"> is set for each language.

Add JSON-LD structured data for profiles, products, and articles.

Optimize all images with alt text (translated per language).

STEP 3: Multilanguage Site Structure
Implement react-i18next (or similar) for translation management.

Store translations in JSON files for Spanish, English, Italian, German, Dutch, and Portuguese.

Refactor routing to use subdirectories for each language: /en/, /es/, /it/, /de/, /nl/, /pt/.

Ensure all internal links, navigation, and emails respect the selected language.

STEP 4: Hreflang, Sitemap, and Robots.txt
Add <link rel="alternate" hreflang="x" href="URL" /> tags for every page, referencing all language versions (including self-referential).

Generate a multilingual sitemap.xml including all language versions of each page.

Reference the sitemap in robots.txt and disallow crawling of private/admin areas.

Submit the sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.

STEP 5: Technical SEO and Performance
Use a CDN for fast global load times.

Compress images, minify assets, and implement lazy loading.

Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility across all languages.

Optimize page speed and Core Web Vitals for each language version.

STEP 6: Content Expansion and Backlink Strategy
Create new landing pages and blog content targeting the competitor’s top keywords and content gaps.

Use culturally relevant language and imagery.

Provide a list of target domains for outreach and link-building based on competitor backlink analysis.

STEP 7: Analytics & Monitoring
Set up Google Search Console and Analytics for all languages.

Track rankings and traffic for target keywords in each region.

Monitor indexing, crawl errors, and user engagement by language.

STEP 8: Testing & Verification
Test all SEO and multilingual functionality in every language.

Use Google Search Console, PageSpeed Insights, and SEO audit tools to verify implementation.

Provide before/after screenshots or screencasts for each step.

Wait for my review and approval before deploying or proceeding to the next step.

Critical Instructions:

Do not break or alter any existing site structure, user data, or user/admin experience outside these enhancements.

All new or changed code must be clearly commented and documented.

If you encounter a blocking issue or uncertainty, STOP and report before proceeding.

Site stability and user experience take priority over new features.

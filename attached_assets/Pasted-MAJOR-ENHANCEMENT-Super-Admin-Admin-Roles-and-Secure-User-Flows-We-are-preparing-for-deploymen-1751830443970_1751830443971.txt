MAJOR ENHANCEMENT: Super Admin, Admin Roles, and Secure User Flows

We are preparing for deployment and require robust role-based access control and secure user flows.
Do not break or regress any existing functionality.
Proceed step by step, and wait for my review after each step.

STEP 1: Design and Document Role-Based User Model
Define three distinct user roles:

Super Admin: Full access, can manage all site settings and create/manage other admin users.

Admin: Access to admin panel for profile/user/content management, but cannot create new admins or change site-wide settings.

Front-End User: Standard site users (shoppers/clients).

Update the user database schema to include a role field (e.g., superadmin, admin, user).

Document the permissions and access boundaries for each role.

Do not proceed until this is documented and approved.

STEP 2: Implement Super Admin Authentication and Management
Create a Super Admin login route (separate from standard admin/user login if needed).

Only Super Admins can access the super admin dashboard.

Super Admin dashboard must allow:

Creating new admin users.

Viewing, editing, and deleting existing admin users.

Secure all super admin routes and actions with strict authentication and authorization checks.

Provide proof of secure Super Admin login and management before proceeding.

STEP 3: Implement Standard Admin Authentication and Permissions
Create a separate login flow for admins (or a unified login with role-based dashboard redirection).

Ensure only users with the admin or superadmin role can access the admin panel.

Enforce permissions so admins cannot access super admin features.

Test that front-end users cannot access any admin or super admin routes.

Provide screenshots or code samples confirming correct access control.

STEP 4: Secure All Admin and Super Admin Routes
Apply middleware or guards to all backend and frontend routes to enforce role-based access.

Ensure all sensitive actions (user management, site settings, etc.) are protected.

Add logging for all admin and super admin actions for audit purposes.

Test and confirm that no unauthorized access is possible.

STEP 5: Establish Front-End User Flow
Document and implement the flow for standard users:

Shopper: Browses site, adds items to cart.

Client: Registers/logs in, can save favorites, manage profile, and check out.

Checkout: Completes purchase via shopping cart.

Ensure smooth transitions between anonymous shopper, registered user, and checkout.

Confirm that user roles are correctly assigned and enforced throughout the flow.

Test the entire front-end flow and provide a user journey summary.

STEP 6: Regression Testing and Verification
After each step, thoroughly test all user flows:

Super admin, admin, and front-end user actions.

Login, dashboard access, and permissions.

Shopping cart, checkout, and profile management.

Confirm that no existing site functionality is broken.

Provide before/after screenshots or screencasts as proof.

Wait for my review and approval before deploying or proceeding to the next step.

Critical Instructions:

Do not break or alter any existing site structure or user/admin experience outside these enhancements.

All code changes must be clearly commented and documented.

If you encounter a blocking issue or uncertainty, STOP and report before proceeding.

Site stability and security are the highest priorities.

Begin with Step 1 (Role-Based User Model Design), and wait for my review before proceeding.

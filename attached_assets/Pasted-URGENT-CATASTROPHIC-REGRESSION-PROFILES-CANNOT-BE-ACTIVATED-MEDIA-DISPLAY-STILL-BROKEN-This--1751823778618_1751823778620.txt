URGENT: CATASTROPHIC REGRESSION – PROFILES CANNOT BE ACTIVATED & MEDIA DISPLAY STILL BROKEN

This is a severe, site-breaking regression. Two major issues must be fixed immediately, with NO further regressions, NO unrelated changes, and NO “no issue found” responses:

1. Catastrophic Issue: Profiles Cannot Be Activated
Current Situation:
In the admin panel, attempting to change any profile from “PENDING” to “ACTIVE” does NOT work. Profiles remain in “PENDING” status, regardless of admin actions.

Expected Behavior:
When an admin sets a profile to “ACTIVE” and saves, the profile status must update in the database and the profile must become visible on the public website.

Severity:
This is catastrophic. It prevents any new profiles from being published and breaks core site functionality.

2. Major Issue: Media Display Still Broken in Profile Edit
Current Situation:
In the admin panel’s profile edit view, uploaded media (photos/videos) for new profiles do NOT display correctly. Instead, sample images are shown, even though thumbnails are correct in the dashboard and files exist on the server.

Expected Behavior:
The profile edit view must show the actual uploaded media for each profile, not sample images.

MANDATORY STEPS TO FIX (DO NOT SKIP OR MERGE STEPS):
A. Profile Activation Bug
Reproduce the Bug:

Attempt to activate a pending profile (e.g., “ARLENY ZORILA”) in the admin panel.

Confirm that the profile remains in “PENDING” status after saving.

Trace the Data Flow:

Check the admin panel’s request to update profile status.

Verify the backend API receives the correct request and updates the database.

Confirm the database status actually changes from “PENDING” to “ACTIVE.”

Confirm the profile is visible on the public site after activation.

Fix the Bug:

Repair the admin panel, backend, or database logic so that status changes are saved and reflected on the front end.

Do NOT change or break any other features.

Demonstrate the Fix:

Show a profile successfully changing from “PENDING” to “ACTIVE,” and appearing on the public site.

Provide before/after screenshots or screencast.

B. Media Display Bug
Reproduce the Bug:

Edit a profile with uploaded media in the admin panel.

Confirm that the edit view does NOT show the actual uploaded media.

Trace the Data Flow:

Follow the media data from the database, through the backend, to the frontend component.

Identify where the correct media references are lost or replaced by sample images.

Fix the Bug:

Repair the code so the profile edit view displays the actual uploaded media.

Do NOT add, remove, or alter any other features or data.

Demonstrate the Fix:

Show the correct media displaying in the profile edit view for a recent profile.

Provide before/after screenshots or screencast.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
Do NOT respond with “no issue found” or “works as designed.”
You must fix these user-facing, site-breaking bugs and provide proof.

Do NOT introduce new features, sample data, or UI changes.

Do NOT break or alter any other site functionality.

Wait for my approval after each fix before proceeding.

If you encounter a blocking issue, STOP and report immediately.

Begin with Step A1: Reproduce and fix the profile activation bug. Provide proof before moving to the media display issue.

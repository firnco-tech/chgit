What’s happening:

The backend is correctly blocking unauthenticated requests to the favorites API (returns 401).

The frontend is not handling the 401 response by prompting the user to register or log in.

As a result, users see a generic error instead of a registration/login modal.

Mission-Critical Prompt for Replit
The backend now correctly requires authentication for the favorites feature. However, the frontend is not handling unauthenticated requests properly. This is mission-critical for user experience and conversion.

Sequential Steps to Fix and Complete the Favorites Feature
Frontend 401 Handling for Favorites

When a user clicks the “Add to Favorites” heart and receives a 401 “Authentication required” from the API, the frontend must:

Immediately display a registration/login modal (not just an error message).

After successful registration/login, retry the original “Add to Favorites” action automatically.

Registration/Login Modal Integration

Implement or connect a modal that allows users to register (with email) or log in.

The modal should be user-friendly and not disrupt the browsing experience.

After successful authentication, close the modal and update the UI to reflect the user’s logged-in state.

Favorites Persistence and Feedback

Once logged in, allow the user to favorite/unfavorite profiles.

Show immediate visual feedback (heart icon filled/unfilled).

Ensure favorites are persisted in the database and reflected in the user’s dashboard.

Testing

Test the entire flow:

As a guest, clicking the heart triggers registration/login.

After registering/logging in, the favorite action completes and the heart updates.

Repeat for unfavoriting.

Confirm admins cannot favorite.

Confirm regular users cannot access admin features.

No existing functionality should be broken.

Error Handling

If registration/login fails, show a clear error and allow the user to try again.

If the favorite action fails for any other reason, show a user-friendly message.

Requirements:

Do NOT break or alter existing site structure or other user flows.

All new code must be clearly commented and documented.

Wait for my review after each step before proceeding.

Begin with Step 1: Implement frontend handling for 401 errors on the favorites API, and integrate the registration/login modal. Wait for my confirmation before continuing.

Summary:
The backend is secure, but the frontend must now provide a smooth, conversion-friendly authentication flow for the favorites feature. This is mission-critical for user engagement and must be completed without breaking any existing functionality.

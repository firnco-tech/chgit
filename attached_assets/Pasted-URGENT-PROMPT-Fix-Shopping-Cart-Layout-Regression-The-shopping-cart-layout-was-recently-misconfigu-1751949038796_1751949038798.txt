URGENT PROMPT: Fix Shopping Cart Layout Regression
The shopping cart layout was recently misconfigured and remains broken despite previous attempts to fix it. I am incurring unnecessary costs due to repeated failed tasks. Please follow these explicit, step-by-step instructions to safely and fully restore the shopping cart layout:

1. Restore the Previous, Working Shopping Cart Layout
Review the last known working version of the shopping cart layout prior to the recent changes.

Revert the cart page and checkout components to that state as a baseline.

Ensure the following elements are present and correctly styled:

Cart item list with profile images, names, and prices.

Quantity controls (if applicable).

Clear "Remove" or "Delete" item buttons.

Order summary with subtotal, taxes/fees (if any), and total.

Prominent "Proceed to Checkout" button.

Match the spacing, alignment, and responsive design of the previous working layout.

2. Safely Reapply Required Enhancements
After restoring the layout, carefully reapply only the necessary enhancements:

Language-aware navigation and URLs.

Translation hooks and language path handling.

Payment success redirect with language prefix.

Updated navigation buttons ("Browse Profiles", "Back to Browse") with language support.

Apply these changes incrementally, testing the cart layout after each step to ensure nothing breaks.

3. Thorough Testing and Validation
Test the cart and checkout flow in all supported languages.

Add and remove profiles from the cart, ensuring all UI elements display correctly.

Confirm that the checkout page displays:

Email and name input fields.

Payment form (credit card fields).

Order summary with all cart items.

Payment button with proper processing states.

Test on both desktop and mobile devices for layout consistency.

Verify that all navigation links and redirects work as intended.

4. Regression and SEO Safeguards
Ensure that no other site functionality, SEO optimizations, or language features are broken or regressed.

Do not alter any unrelated code or components.

All changes must be clearly commented and documented.

5. Reporting and Approval
Provide before/after screenshots of the cart and checkout pages.

Summarize exactly what was changed and why.

Wait for my review and explicit approval before making any further changes.

Critical Instructions:

Do NOT break or alter any existing site structure, user data, or admin/user experience outside this fix.

If you encounter any blocking issue or uncertainty, STOP and report before proceeding.

This prompt requires a careful, stepwise restoration and enhancement of the shopping cart layout, with rigorous testing and no further regressions.

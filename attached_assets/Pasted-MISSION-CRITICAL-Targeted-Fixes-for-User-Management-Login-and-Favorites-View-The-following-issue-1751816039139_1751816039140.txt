MISSION-CRITICAL: Targeted Fixes for User Management, Login, and Favorites View

The following issues must be fixed sequentially, with careful testing after each step, and without breaking or altering any existing site features or user/admin flows:

1. Fix "View Details" Button in User Management
The "View Details" button for registered users in the admin panel is not clickable.

Diagnose and repair the backend route or frontend handler so that clicking "View Details" opens the correct user detail view or modal.

Confirm that admin can view all relevant user information after the fix.

2. Fix Login Session Issue
After logging out and logging back in, the system says "Welcome back, you have successfully logged in" but does not actually log the user in.

Investigate and resolve session handling and authentication logic to ensure that, after login, the user is fully authenticated and can access their account and features as expected.

Test login/logout flows for both admin and regular users to ensure reliability.

3. Fix Favorites Page 404 Error
When a user clicks the "Favorites" button to view their selected favorites, a 404 Page Not Found error occurs.

Diagnose and repair the routing and backend endpoint for the favorites view so users can access and see their favorited profiles.

Ensure the favorites page is only accessible to authenticated users and displays the correct data.

4. Regression Testing
After each fix, verify that:

No existing functionality is broken.

Registration, login, logout, user management, and favoriting all work as intended for both admin and regular users.

Provide screenshots or code samples for verification before moving to the next step.

Critical Instructions:

Do not break or alter any existing site structure, user data, or admin/user experience.

All new or changed code must be clearly commented and documented.

Pause and report if any step cannot be completed as described.

Begin with Step 1 (View Details button), and wait for my review before proceeding to the next step.
